abstract: "This study examines the relationship between income inequality, as measured by the Gini Index, and national happiness scores. Incorporating other socio-economic factors such as the Democracy Index and Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index, we explore the depth of this relationship. The study aims to inform policy by identifying the broader determinants of happiness beyond economic measures."

2.  *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    -   Dataset was created by Carl Fernandes for University of Toronto
3.  *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*

**Composition**

1.  **What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent?**

    The dataset instances represent individual countries, with each instance encapsulating various socio-economic indicators for the year 2022.

2.  **How many instances are there in total?**

    There are 100 instances, each corresponding to a unique country.

3.  **Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample of instances from a larger set?**

    The dataset is a sample of countries from the year 2022, selected based on the availability of complete data for the variables of interest.

4.  **What data does each instance consist of?**

    Each instance consists of the country's name, the Gini Index, Democracy Index, Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI), and the corresponding Happiness Score for 2022.
